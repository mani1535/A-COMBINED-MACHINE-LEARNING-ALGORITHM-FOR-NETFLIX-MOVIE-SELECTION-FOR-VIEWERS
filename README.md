# A COMBINED MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM FOR NETFLIX MOVIE SELECTION FOR VIEWERS
This project aims to give recommendations on movies and stories on Netflix using machine learning algorithms.
 The system leverages a dataset of Netflix movies and TV shows to analyze viewer preferences and predict movie suggestions. The methodology involves collecting and preprocessing data, followed by training and testing various machine learning models like Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression.
